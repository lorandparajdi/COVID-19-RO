Based on the [COVID-19 Romania database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorandparajdi/COVID-19-RO/master/dataROCSV.csv)
this is a simple MATLAB live script to analyze the data from Romania and All the World. 

We use for data fetting seven basic functions:
- the linear function
- the exponential function
- three parameters logistic function
- three parameters Gompertz function
- polynomial function with number of therms 5
- the Gaussian function
- the Fourier function with number of therms 3
